                <h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Welcome to FasFill</h2>
                <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We invite you to read this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), which explains our privacy practices and how we handle personal information collected through Fasfill, as well as through our marketing activities and other such activities described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy also explains how we use and share such information and choices you have about your personal information.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We take care of your personal data and undertake to safeguard its confidentiality and security.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We use “Fasfill” to refer to the website and our iOS and Android mobile apps (also referred to as our “Services”). We also use “Fasfill,” “our platform,” “us,” and “our” to refer to the services as described in this policy Agreement.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unless otherwise indicated, this Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services in all geographies in which Fasfill offers its Services.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What Personal Information Is Collected?</h3>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When you visit Fasfill, we may collect personal information about you from you directly, through technology that automatically collects information from your browser or device, and from third party sources. We refer to this automatically collected information as “Device Information.” Moreover, we might collect the personal data you provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment information, etc.) during registration to be able to fulfil the agreement.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In order to optimise your experience with Fasfill, we may also require further information such as your geolocation which we may use to confirm your address and help us operate or personalize our Services, including by tagging posts, providing information on or adding information to a map, and helping us show you more relevant content or ads.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any personal information that we collect will be used and processed in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why do we process your data?</h3>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is necessary to maintain the App. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">information regarding App usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify any particular user of the platform.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You can visit Fasfill without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Platform’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence, organization, telephone number, etc. You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Platform’s features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us via <a href="mailto:info@gridhall.com" class="a" target="_blank">info@gridhall.com</a> or by visiting this page on our website <a href="https://gridhall.com/public/contact-us" class="a" target="_blank">https://gridhall.com/contact-us</a>.</p>

                <p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We process your data to verify accounts using several techniques, including checking against third party data and public records, verification codes, or geo-verification.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Advertisers provide us with information about their users or potential customers to help us personalize advertising and measure the performance of their advertisements. We may equally process your information to improve our Services to you such as by responding to your support requests and comments, diagnose and resolve problems, and monitor usage and resource needs.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We may need to communicate with you about Fasfill or our Services, including by sending announcements, updates, security alerts, and support messages via email, notifications, and text messages.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Creating and maintaining a trusted environment is another reason we collect and process your information.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To detect and prevent fraud, spam, abuse, security incidents, and other harmful, unauthorized, unethical, illegal, or otherwise objectionable activity or content.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To conduct security investigations, audits, and risk assessments. To comply with our legal obligations.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To confirm or authenticate information or identification.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We use personal information for research and development purposes. As part of these activities, we may generate aggregated, de-identified and/or other anonymous data from personal information we collect. We do this by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you or other individuals. We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyse and improve our Services and promote Fasfill.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Is My Personal Information Shared with Others?</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fasfill is a platform to share helpful information with others within your community. To that end, the content you post on Fasfill, such as posts, replies, and recommendations may be visible to other Users, businesses, governments and agencies, or the public,</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We may share personal information with our verification partners, such as telecommunications providers (if you choose to confirm your account by providing your telephone number) or other data providers, to try to make sure that you are who you say you are.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In compliance with legal and safety measures, we may retain, preserve, or share your Content and personal information with law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties if we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond, as required by applicable law, to a valid, binding legal request (e.g. a subpoena, a search warrant, court order, or other legal process from government or law enforcement); (b) detect, investigate, prevent, and address fraud and other unauthorized, illegal or unethical activity, security, or technical issues; (c) protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety; (d) enforce our User Agreement or any other agreements we have with you; (e) prevent physical injury or other harm to any person or entity, including you and Users of the general public.

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We may also share personal information with service providers and/or data processors to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.
